\begin{itemize}
    \item Access point (AP): any entity that has station functionallity and
        provides access to a wireless network.
    \item Basic service set (BSS): set of wireless stations executing the same
        MAC protocl and competing for access in the same medium.
    \item Coordination function (CF): protocol used to transmit PDUs (protocol
        data unit) when station is operating inside a BSS.
    \item Distribution system (DS): system to connect a set of BSS and LANs to
        create an ESS (extended service set).
    \item Extended service set (ESS): set of one or more BSS and LANs that are
        considered by the LLC (logical link control) as one.
    \item MAC protocol data unit (MPDU): unit of data of MAC protocol.
    \item MAC service data unit (MSDU): unit of information in the LLC protocol.
    \item Station: any 802.11 compliant device.
\end{itemize}

APs are identified either by the \textbf{SSID} (service set identifier) or the
\textbf{BSSID} (basic service set identifier). Stations and AP exchange two type
of frames: data frames and admin frames, used to establish AP and station
associations, and network discovery among others. There exist three association
states: not authenticated therefore not associated, authenticated and not
associated, and authenticated and associated. A terminal can only be associated
to an AP at a time, association can only take place after authentication.\\

IEE 802.11 or WLAN only deals with the last communication hop, it does not deal
with end to end communication. There is not a stablished procedure for key
agreement, typically every station and AP in a BSS use the same PSK, althought
the standard allows $ 4 $ PSKs per BSS. \\

APs can announce their existance using beacons containing the SSID. Stations
passively scann all the channels looking for those beacons and sending probes
to connect to a particular SSID or any. When one of those probes reaches the
target AP, it replies with a probe-response. There are two authentication models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Open system authentication (OSA): any station can connect to the AP.
    \item Shared key authentication (SKA or PSK): before the authentication
        process a symmetric key was pre-shared. Challenge-response protocol:
        station asks for connection, AP challenges the station (to verify it
        knows the key), AP sends pseudorandom number in clear, station encrypts
        the pseudorandom number and sends it back to the AP, finally AP decrypts
        and verifies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Wired equivalent priacy - WEP}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Wired equivalent priacy - WEP}

Used to encrypt wireless trafic, it uses RC4 stream cipher witha key length of
$ 40 $ or $ 104 $ bits.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{./fig/wep.tex}
    \caption{WEP encryption diagram}
\end{figure}

This scheme has several vulnerabilities. To begin with, the authentication is
one way, only the AP authenticates the station so fake AP may be used. Key
distribution is manual which may end up in [un]wanted key disclosure. Key size
is too small combined with stream cipher keystream reuseage vulnerability. CRC
integrity function is not cryptographically secure. \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fake authetication: $ C \oplus M = (M \oplus KS) \oplus M = KS $.
        C: challenge, R: response, KS: key stream.
    \item Key authentication: key should be regularly changed to avoid KS
        repetition. Not practical due to manual redistribution.
    \item Pseudo authentication: BSSIDs and SSIDs can be faked.
    \item Handoff: roamning between BSSs from the same ESS (moving from one
        AP with weak signal to an other with stronger one). This implies a new
        authenticaion process.
    \item Two time pad: $ c_1 \oplus c_2 = m_1 \oplus m_2 $. Crib dragging.
\end{itemize}

Due to the small length of the IV collision may (and will) happen which implies
same keystreams. Birthday paradox states that a collision will happen with a
probability $ P > 0.5 $. The IV may be predictable on AP reset (it depends on
the manufacturer). To speedup packet generation, therefore IV collision, fake
pakets can be sent. Also the ciphertect can be modified because CRC is not
cryptographically secure. \\

No clue how attacks on wep work! \\

\subsection*{WPA and WPA2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{WPA and WPA2}

A replacement for WEP is needed, two alternatives WPA (Wi-Fi protected access)
and WPA2. They have both two modes: personal (PSK) and enterprise (EAP).

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|}
        \cline{2-4}
        & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{WEP} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{WPA} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{WPA2} \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Authentication} & N/A & IEEE 802.1x/EAP/PSK & IEEE802.1x/EAP/PSK \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Encryption Algorithm} & RC4 & RC4 & AES \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Key Size} & 40/104 bits & 128 bits & 128 bits \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Encryption Method} & WEP & TKIP & CCMP \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Data Integrity} & CRC-32 & MIC & MIC \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{IV size} & 24 bits & 48 bits & 48 bits \\ \hline
        \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Per paket key} & No & Yes & Yes \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Both protocols are divided in 5 phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discovery: the purpose of this phase is for the station and the AP
        recognize each other, agree on a set of security capabilities and
        establish an association for future communication. This process requires
        three steps: AP discovery using beacons and probes (as in WEP),
        authentication request from the station to the AP and negotiation of
        security policies and authentication mechanisms.
    \item Authentication (Enterpriese Mode): enables mutual authentication
        between a station and an authentication server (AS) located in the
        enterprise. Authentication is designed to only allow authorized stations
        in the network and assure the station that is communicating with a
        legitimate network. This process requires three steps: connect to AS,
        extensible authentication protocol (EAP) and secure key delivery. EAP
        (extensible access protocol) was designed for the authentication in
        Ethernet network.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \input{./fig/EAP.tex}
            \caption{EAP authentication protocol}
        \end{figure}

        EAP may be combined with TLS and certificates.
    \item Key management: at the beggining we had the PSK in phase 2 EAPK (master
        session key) is negotiated and from they both we can derive PMK (pairwise
        master key). PMS is used to create KCK (key confirmation key), KEK (key
        encryption key) and TK (temporary key).

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \input{./fig/WPA_key_hierarchy.tex}
            \caption{WPA key hierarchy}
        \end{figure}

        $ PTK = f(PMK, Anonce, Snonce, Auth MAC, Sup MAC) $:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item PMK: pairwise master key.
            \item Anonce: random number generated in the AP.
            \item Snonce: random number generated in the Station.
            \item Auth MAC: MAC address of the autenticating entity.
            \item Sup MAC: MAC address of the authenticated entity.
        \end{itemize}

        The PTK is 512 bits long and it contains trhee 128 bits keys: KCK, KEK,
        TK. \\

        Group key handshake: establish key for multicast traffic.

    \item Protected data transfer: between station and AP. Two protocols studied:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item WPA: TKIP (temporal key integrity protocol). It uses 64 bit MIC
                (message integrity code) for integrity and RC4 for
                confidentiality. TKIP is designed as a wrapper for WEP. It can
                be implemented in software and can reuse existing WEP hardware.
                The improvements are:

                \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{10cm}|}
                \hline
                \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Purpose} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Change} \\ \hline
                Message Integrity & Add a message integrity protocol to prevent tampering that can be implemented in software on a low-power microprocessor. \\ \hline
                IV selection and use & Change the rules for how initialization vector values are selected and reuse the initialization vector as a replay counter. \\ \hline
                Per-Packet Key Mixing & Change the encryption key for every frame. \\ \hline
                IV Size & Increase the size of the IV to avoid ever reusing the same initialization vector \\ \hline
                Key Management & Add a mechanism to distribute and change the broadcast keys. \\ \hline
                \end{tabular}
                \end{table}

                It wraps WEP with three elements: MIC, function for low bandwith
                CPU, essentially a 64 bit has funciton. Longer IV for RC4
                function, it is based on the TK that is different for each
                connection. Per paket key mixing, is a mechanism to derive a key
                for each paket.

            \item WPA2: CCMP (counter mode-CBC MAC protocol). It uses AES-128 in
                CBC-MAC mode for integrity and AES-128 in CRT mode for
                confidentiality.
        \end{itemize}

    \item Connection end: secure connection discarded, go back to original state.
\end{enumerate}

Personal WPA and WPA2 can be attacked using a dictionary attack. Success depends
on the randomness and size. An other problem is that there is a different PTK per
client so it requires a different attack per client (but once known the PSK is
trivial) so it is required to capture a client association packet. Enterprise
WPA and WPA2 can be attacked using impersonation attack. PEAP (protected
extensible authentication protocol) and EAP-TTLS (tunneled TLS). It could also
suffer a DoS attack or a downgrade to WEP attack.
