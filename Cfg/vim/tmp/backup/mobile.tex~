\subsection*{1G - $ 1^{st} $ generation networks}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1G - $ 1^{st} $ generation networks}

It appeared in the $ 70s $ and was developed during the $ 80s $. It is based on
analogical technologies and it has low capacity, $ 8 \sim 10 Kbps $. Two
different standards:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ETACS: european total access communication system, $ 25 KHz $ bandwith
        and two different channels $ 890 \sim 915 MHz $ for transmission from MS
        to BS and $ 935 \sim 960 MHz $ for transmission from BS to MS.

    \item AMPS: american mobile phone system (AT\&T). $ 30 KHz $ bandwith and
        two different channels $ 824 \sim 848 MHz $ for transmission from MS to
        BS and $ 869 \sim 894 MHz $ for transmission from BS to MS.
\end{itemize}

It has several vulnerabilities, such as: limited numbr of users, interference
of the analogical signal, no authentication and no encryption.

\subsection*{2G - GSM}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2G - GSM}

Global system for mobile comunication (GSM). Was developed to provide higher
quality mobile voice communication and disagned for digitalized voice. It was
developed by ETSI (european telecomunicaions standards institute) and the first
comercial solution apeared in 1995 in USA. It uses quad band $ 850 \mid 900 \mid
1800 \mid 1900 MHz $. Te goals are to avoid fraud and to be as secure as the
land lines. Two identifying elements are introduced:

\begin{itemize}
    \item SIM: subscriber identity module.
    \item IMEI: international mobile equipment identity.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \caption{GSM infrastructure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/GSM_infrastructure.png}
\end{figure}

SIM can perform two criptographic algorithms: \textit{A3} and \textit{A8}. It
has associated a TMSI (temporal mobile subscriber identity) and a LAI (local
area identity). SIM card stores 256K and it holds $ k_i $ (subscriber
authentication key), IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity), PIN
(personal identificatio number) and PUK (personal unlock key). \\

LAI is a number that uniquely identifies each LA within a GSM PLMN. It is
divided in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MCC: mobile country code, 3 digits.
    \item MNC: mobile network code, 2/3 digits.
    \item LAC: local area code, max 16 bits. Each LAC is assigned by a VLR.
\end{itemize}

Appending CI (cell identity, 16 bit max) value to LAI we obtain CGI (cell global
identity). When the connection is stablished between MS and BTS the LAI is
checked to see if they are the same. BTS broadcasts LAC periodically. A PLMN is
identified by MCC and MNC. \\

IMSI, it is how the subscriber identifies in the network. Is embedded in the SIM.
It is divided in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MCC: mobile country code, 3 digits.
    \item MNC: mobile network code, 2/3 digits.
    \item MSIN: mobile subscriber identification number, max 10 digits.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Authentication}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Authentication}

Verify the identity and the validity of the SIM card through the network and
ensure that the subscriber has authorized access to the network.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the PIN is valid, SIM retrieves the IMSI (or TMSI).
    \item MS sends IMSI to the nearest BTS and to MSC/VLR. If TMSI is sent
        instead, MSC/VLR obtain IMSI from TMSI and sends it HLR.
    \item HLR/AUC generate triplet: $ RAND $, $ XRES $ and $ k_s $; and send
        them to MSC/VLR. In practice 5 triplets are created but only one is used,
        the others are saved to reduce roaming handover time.
    \item MSC/VLR send $ RAND $ to MS and waits for the $ SRES $ to compare to
        $ XRES $ and authenticate or not.
\end{enumerate}

A3 algorithm is used to genererate the $ SRES $ from the $ RAND $, it is a keyed
one-way function. It is a propietary algorithm (vulnerable). 4 bytes in the
second round depend on 4 bytes of the first one so the difussion is bad. SIM may
be cloned and $ k_i $ can be obtained in hours with a rogue station. A8
algorithm is used to generate the session key, this key is used to encrypt data
and voice; and it is 64 bits long. $ k_i $ is generated in the SIM and
transferred to the MS and it is used by A5 algorithm. To clone the SIM is
required the IMSI and the $ k_i $, if two clones are identified in the same LA,
both are invalidated. \\

In this scheme the network authenticates the user but not the other way around.
There must exist a trust relation between the components of the network (BTS,
BSC, ...). GSM just encrypts the first hop (MS $ \leftrightarrow $ BTS).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \input{./fig/GSM_auth.tex}
    \caption{GSM authentication process.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Confidentiality}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Confidentiality}

MS is identified by IMSI, then a valid TMSI is created for the LA and sent
encrypted to the MS. VLR associates TMSI with the IMSI. IMSI is only used if
TMSI is not valid for the current LA. If LAI is changed so it is the TMSI. Any
BTS could ask for the IMSI that is sent in plaintext so attacks using rogue
stations can be done. \\

A5 algorithm encrypts de data. It is implemented in hardware, not in SIM. A5/1
and A5/2 are stream ciphers that combine $ k_c $ with frame number to encrypt
the data. All MS must implement A5/0 (no security at all), A5/1 and A5/2. Same
$ k_c $ is used for all the  A5/x algorithms so several attacks can be performed.
For instance you could capture data encrypted with A5/3, then set a rogue station
downgrading the service to A5/2, obtain $ k_c $ and finally decript the
previously captured data.

\subsection*{GPRS \& EDGE}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{GPRS \& EDGE}

General paket radio service (GPRS). Intermediate technology between 2G and 3G.
Two new elements needed in the infrastructure: SGNS (service GPRS support node)
and GGSN (gateway GPRS support node), they are both standarized by ETSI.
Authentication protocol is the same as in GSM, encryption is performed over
the link layer (LLC) instead of the physical layer (like in GSM) and it is
enhanced wit GEA (GPRS encryption algoritm):

\begin{itemize}
    \item GEA/0: no encryption.
    \item GEA/1: 96 bit propietary stream cipher. 64 bit key. Widely used.
    \item GEA/2: 125 bit propietary stream cipher. 64 bit key. Widely used.
    \item GEA/3: 128 bit standard bit block cipher. 64 bit key. Only used in
        new networks.
    \item GEA/4: 128 bit standard bit block cipher. 128 bit key. Not used.
\end{itemize}

A5/3 and GEA/3 are based on Kasumi (3GPP) algorithm, a binary stream key
generator. As input it has $ K_c $, a counter and an additional direction. \\

Enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE). Implemented within GSM network. It
can be used for any application that implements packet commutation for data
connections, such as Internet. No need for additional hardware and easy to
implement in GSM network. It could increase up to four times GPRS traffic. EDGE
uses the same mechanisms as GPRS, it is just an implementation in the physical
layer. It provides a new modulation scheme called ``phase shift in 8 states'',
that allows up to $ 475 Kbps $. Change in the signaling data rate between MS and
MSC/VLR. Change in the radio interface in the base station subsystem â€“ BSS,
especially in the hardware at both link points (MS).

\subsection*{3G - UMTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3G - UMTS}

Previous soulutions were not compatible worldwide (band frequency, A5
implementation ...). There is a need to develop one standard for the whole world.
The objective is to make user ME small and cheap, interoperable with satellite
systems, robustness in high demanding locations, global roaming, voice quality
for data transmission (at least $ 2Mbps $), GSM compatible. \\

Universal mobile telecomunication system (UMTS) is an ETSI/SMG (special mobile
group) standard and developed by 3GPP ($ 3^{rd} $ generation partnership
project). It uses WCDMA (wideband code division multiple access). Specifies a
complete network system supporting older ones. It has two main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item UTRAN: UMTS radio access network.
    \item CN: core network.
\end{itemize}

The base station is now called Node B, its main function is to modulate and
demodulate signals. The base transceiver station is called RNC (radio network
controller), it controls the radioresources (segmentation, assembly), in charge
of encryption. \\

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \caption{UMTS infrastructure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/UMTS_infrastructure.png}
\end{figure}

The most important advantages is the increasement of bandwith, QoS, international
roaming USIM (universal subscriber identity module) better than the GSM SIM.
Security wise, the network is also authentified, best cryptographical algorithms,
integrity of the data is used, IPSEC can be used.

\subsubsection*{Authentication}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Authentication}

It is done trhoug AKA (authentication and key agreement). Three entities are
involved in the process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Home environment (HE or VHE): represented by the authentication center
        (AUC).
    \item Serving network (SN): represented by SGSN that authenticates de
        subscriber and provides mobility management, session management and
        interaction with other SNs.
    \item User equipement: represented by the USIM. Verifies that the SN has been
        authenticated by the HE.
\end{itemize}

Trust between SN and HE is needed. To perform AKA, USIM and HE must share $ k_i $
in advance. After the protocol is applied three 128 bits keys are derived:
CK (cipher key), IK (integrity key), AK (anonimity key). This protocol is
applied during user's first sign up, request for location update or request of
connection and disconnection. The procedure is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item UE stablishes connection sending it's security capabilities and TMSI
        (or IMSI).
    \item The SGSN request HE to authenticate UE in the network.
    \item SGSN asks the challenge and returns to the UE $ RAND $ and $ AUTN $
        (authentication token).
    \item UE verifies the $ AUTN $, computes $ SRES $ and sends it back.
    \item Network checks $ SRES $
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{./fig/UMTS_auth.tex}
    \caption{UMTS authentication process.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \subfigure[Network AKA vector]{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./img/Network_AKA.png}}
    \subfigure[User AKA vector]{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./img/User_AKA.png}}
\end{figure}

The network has a SQN per subscriber that is updated after every authentication.
It is used to authenticate the network. A rogue station cannot generate valid
SQN and MAC. $ fx $ are implemented in AUC and USIM. They are similar functions
but the ouptut of one function does not provide information about the others.

\subsubsection*{Confidentiality}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Confidentiality}

MILENAGE algorithm is the default in all $ f $ functions, it is based on AES
block chain and operates on RLC (radio link control). For encryption $ f8 $ is
used, it is stream cipher that takes as parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ COUNTâ€“C $: time variable, 32 bits.
    \item $ BEARER $: representing the value for different radio carrier from
        the same user, 5 bits.
    \item $ DIRECTION $: state if is up/downlink, 1 bit.
    \item $ LENGTH $: length for the generated frame key stream.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Integrity}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Integrity}

$ f9 $ is an integrity algorithm. Used to protect integrity and authentication
of the data source. Generates a MAC code of 32 bits. Based on Kasumi CBC. It
takes the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ COUNT $: 1 frame variable, protection against reply, 32 bits.
    \item $ FRESH $: nonce 32 bits.
    \item $ MESSAGE $:is the message, if one is wish.
    \item $ DIRECTION $: state if is up/downlink, 1 bit.
\end{itemize}

$ f9 $ is only applied for the integrity of signaling data at RRC (radio
resource control) layer due to performance and the amount of data signalized in
a channel. For the functions $ f8 $ and $ f9 $ was to early to implement AES,
standarization was purposed but never carried out. Kasumi is used because there
are no practical attacks and it has an operation mode to work as stream cipher.

\subsection*{4G - LTE}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{4G - LTE}

The major motivation is to obtain higher data rates and improve QoS. It also has
backwards compatibility, lower complexity, packet switched system, improved
system latency ($ 10 ms $), higher mobility ($ 350 km/h $). It has two access
modes FDD and TDD. Two transmission schemes down link $ \rightarrow $ OFDMA and
up link $ \rightarrow $ SC-FDMA. It uses MIMO technology to improve data
capacity, multiple antennas to increase coverage and physical layer capacity.
There are trhee categories:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Path diversity.
    \item Beamsteering: is associated with the physical layer characteristics of
        the radio signal by controling its phase and amplitude.
    \item Spatial multiplexing: allows the simultaneous transmission of more
        than one stream of data in time and frequency.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \input{./fig/MIMO.tex}
            \caption{MIMO scheme}
        \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

SIMO $ + $ MISO $ \ne $ MIMO and transmit diversity $ + $ receive diversity
$ \ne $ spatial multiplexing. Just because there is more than one antenna does
not mean that it is MIMO. Diversity can be combined with MIMO spatial
multiplexing to improve performance, for MIMO to work paths must be correlated. \\

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \caption{LTE infrastructure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/LTE_infrastructure.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item eNB: evolved node B. The only functional element to access the network.
    \item MME: mobility management entity. Singnaling server, similar to SGSN.
        Mobility and session management.
    \item S-GW: service getway. User traffic interchange between access network
        and IP network core. Anchor for transfers between other 3GPP networks.
        Routing/handover of eNB, P-GW and SGSN.
    \item P-GW: PDN gateway. Traffic interchange with external networks. Key to
        policy enforcement and collection of data pricing. Anchor for handover
        with non-3GPP networks.
    \item PCRF: policy and charging rule function. Central database of EPS system
        users. Identities, service data and user location.
    \item HSS: home subscriber server. It stores mobility, service data of each
        subscriber, has the AuC. QoS policy management and pricing.
\end{itemize}

LTE uses multiple planes, logical multiplexed planes in RF. (1) User plane (AS):
for the traffic in data network. (2) Control plane (NAS): signaling traffic,
session/routing, source/destination control, etc. (3) Management plane: for the
management traffic, kind subset of (2). \\

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
    \centering
    \input{./fig/LTE_stack.tex}
\end{wrapfigure}

LTE stack:

\begin{itemize}
    \item NAS: non access stratum. Functional layer between core network and UE.
        Manages stablishment of communication sessions for continuous
        communication with the UE as it moves.
    \item RRC: radio resources control. transfer NAS messages, user plane
        information may be included.
    \item PDCP: paket data convergence protocol. Header compression, radio
        encryption, integrity protection of control plane, duplicate detection.
    \item RLC: radio link control. Redirect pakets to be transferred over the
        air interface. Re-segmentation, concatenation, duplicate detection.
    \item MAC: medium access control. Multiplexing and QoS.
    \item PHY: logical transport channel mapping, traffic volume measurement,
        [de]multiplexing, priority handling, transport format selection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Authentication}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Authentication}

Process to verify if the user is an authorized subscriber of the network to
which he is trying to access. Various authentication procedures available:

\begin{itemize}
    \item LTE uses the EPS AKA procefure for mutual authentication between users
        and the network, in two steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item HSS generates EPS authentication vector ($RAND$, $AUTN$,
                $XRES$, $K_{ASME}$) and delivers them to a MME.
            \item MME selects one of the authentication vectors and uses it for
                mutual authentication with an UE and shares the same key
                ($K_{ASME}$) with each other.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item Mutual authentication: since the user service network ID is required
        for generating the authentication vector, the authentication of the
        network by the user is performed in addition to the user's authentication
        by the network.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Confidentiality}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Confidentiality}

It is protected the air interface connection between UE and eNB. There are
currently three algorithms EEA/1, EEA/2, EEA/3 with 128 bit keys (extendible up
to 256 bits). Encryption and decryption done on PDCP and NAS. Several keysa are
derived:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ K $: 128 bits master key. Embedded into USIM and HSS by carrier.
    \item $ CK \& IK $: 128 bits cipher and integrity keys.
    \item $ K_{ASME} $: 256 bits local master key derived from $ CK \& IK $.
    \item $ K_{eNB} $: 256 bits key used by the eNB to derive more keys.
    \item $ K_{NASenc} \& K_{NASint} $: 256/128 bits key protecting the NAS.
    \item $ K_{RRcenc} \& K_{RRCint} $: 256/128 bits key protecting the RRC.
    \item $ K_{UPenc} \& K_{UPint} $: 256/128 bits key protecting the user
        plane traffic.
\end{itemize}

EEA algorithm (used for encryption) and EIA algorithm (used for integrity) take
as input parameters: $K$ appropiate key, $COUNT$ time variable, $BEARER$ value
that represents the same key for different radio bearers of the single user,
$DIRECTION$ states [up/down]link, $LENGTH$ key length for the frame flow
generated. Three algoritms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item EEA1/EIA1: based on SNOW3G. Stream cipher. As different from Kasumi as
        possible, selected during UMTS security design. Allows low power
        consumption and low gate count implementation in hardware.
    \item EEA2/EIA2: based on AES-CCM. CMAC mode for MAC integrity. Chosen
        because eNB already supports AES.
    \item EEA3/EIA3: based on ZUC stream cipher.
\end{itemize}

LTE backhaul, is the portion of hierarchical network comprising the intermediate
links between the core and the subnets at its edges. Backhaul must be protected,
infrastructure may be shared and is not always possible to trust physical
security of an eNB.
