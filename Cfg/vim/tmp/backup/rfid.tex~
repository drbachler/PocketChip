\textbf{\textit{Automatic Identification Systems}}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bar codes: bars and spaces encoded characters. Read by an optical
        scanner and processed by a computer. It requires visibility, it
        identifies product type, not product as unit, it is easily damaged. Bar
        codes are standarized: UPC (universal product code), EAN (european
        article numbering). EAN 13 (13 digits): 3 for country code, 6 for
        producer code, 3 for item code, 1 for control.

    \item OCR (optical character recognition): identify characters from image.
        It has a high price.

    \item Smart cards.

    \item Biometric systems.

    \item Etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{RFID} (radio frequency identification) is a method for storing and
retrieving data using devices called RFID tags. An RFID tag is a small device
that can be incorporated into an object, person or animal for proper
identification using radio waves. They are composed by an antenna, a radio
transducer (convert), microchip to make computations, memory and [de]codification
circuit. RFID tags show different characteristics at different frequencies, the
operating frequency ranges are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Low frequency: $ 120 \sim 134\ kHz $. (ISO11784/5 ISO14223).
    \item High frequency: $ 13.56\ MHz $. (ISO15693/ ISO14443/ISO 18000-3).
    \item Ultra high frequency (UHF): $ 850 \sim 960\ MHz $.
        (ISO18000-6, EPCGlobal).
\end{itemize}

According to energy consumption, RFID tags can be classified as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pasive: no internal battery, power supplied by the reader. Smallest and
        cheapest ones. Read distance up to $ 3.3m $.
    \item Semi-pasive: internal battery to power up the chip, energy from the
        reader is needed for retransmission. Read distance up to $ 10m $.
    \item Active: internal battery with lifetime up to 10 years. May be used for
        high end product tracing. Read distance is more than $ 10m $.
\end{itemize}

Each country imposes regulations withrespect to: channels, power to transit and
frequencies. Several standards are created. EPC (electronic product code) world
first RFID standard it later becomes the global electronic product code (EPC C1
G2), operates in UHF, passive, 65 KB. EPC is 96 bits long and is divided in four:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Header: 8 bits. Identify length, type, structure and EPS generation.

    \item EPC Administrator: 28 bits. Maker, responsible entity, request entity
        responsible of keeping all subsequent partition (268 millions of
        companies)

    \item Object class: 24 bits. Identify the object class.
    \item Serial number: 36 bits. Identify the instance.
\end{itemize}

Passive tags have serious restrictions in computing power and storage.
Incorporate CRC, a 16 bit PRNG and two pins, one for access and an other for
killing the tag. It supports the operations: select, aimed to select a group
of tags; inventory, identification of a specific tag; and acces, used when tag
is already selected; also ultralight bitwise operations like AND, OR and XOR.
Memory structure is divided in four blocks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Memory reserved: read only, it contains sensitive data like access and
        kill PINs.
    \item EPC or UII (unique item identifier). As defined in EPC C1 G2.
    \item TID: tag identifier 8 bits. unequivocally identify the commands and
        optional features that the label supports.
    \item User memory: optional. Additional functions like CRC and PRNG.
\end{itemize}

One of the main problems is that EPC is sent in plaintext (4), so traking of
products is really easy, evem for an adversary. There are several threats to
this system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware layer:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Confidentiality: side-channels attack $ \rightarrow $ deduce
            information, fault attacks $ \rightarrow $ heating or cooling,
            physical manipulation $ \rightarrow $ change ROM cells or deasembly.

        \item Integrity: modification of data, impersonation $ \rightarrow $
            cloning card, exchange tags, reprogramming tags.

        \item Availablity: extraction, physical destruction of the tag, abuse of
            ``kill'' command (can be bruteforced), waste resources $ \rightarrow $
            batteries can be discharged.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Communication layer:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Confidentiality: distant read with powerfull reader, privacy
            $ \rightarrow $ trace the tag, compromise the key (it leads to other
            attacks).

        \item Integrity: relay attack, reconstruction of messages, data
            modification, data insertion.

        \item Availablity: active interference, signal degradation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Electronic passport}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Electronic passport}

ICAO (international civil aviation organization) standards for e-passports.
Authentication can use four different metods: data authentication, chip
authentication, terminal authentication, passport holder authentication. Is done
through four mechanisms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Passive authentication: ICAO obligatory. Digital signature in the
        passport chip (signed by issuing state). It has 16 data grups (DG): DG1
        MRZ (machine readable zone), DG2 facial image, DG3 fingerprints...

    \item BAC (basic access control): ICAO optional, EU obligatory. Prevents non
        authorized access and eavesdropping. The reader tests the knowledge of
        MRZ, data is read only if the reader probes the knowledge of the MRZ. A
        key is derived for integrity and confidentiality.

    \item Active authentication: authentication is done by the chip to avoid
        cloning. A challenge is signed by the passport chip.

    \item EAC (extended access control): only in EU, obligatory for advanced
        biometric systems. More secure challenge based scheme. Terminal sends
        its certificate to the chip so it can be checked, the chip sends a
        challenge and the terminal signs it (with the cert provided before).
\end{enumerate}

The MRZ scheme is as follows:

\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item Line 1: $ A<BBB(C)^+<<(D_1)^+<(D_2)^*<(<)^* $
    \begin{itemize}[label={}]
        \item $ A $: indicates the type of document, for the passport is a P.
        \item $ BBB $: country code, for Spain is ESP.
        \item $ C $: primary identifier, at least one character.
        \item $ << $: separator for the primary identifier.
        \item $ D_x $: secondary identifiers, at least one with at least one
            character.
        \item $ (<)^* $: padding, may have length 0.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Line 2: $ EEEEEEEEEFGGGHHHHHHIJKKKKKKLMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMNO $
    \begin{itemize}[label={}]
        \item $ E $: document number.
        \item $ F $: chech digit for document number.
        \item $ G $: nationality of the owner.
        \item $ H $: date of birth of the owner.
        \item $ I $: check digit for the birth date.
        \item $ J $: gender of the owner $ \in \{M \mid F\} $.
        \item $ K $: date of expiration.
        \item $ L $: check digit for expirtion date.
        \item $ M $: optional data (up to the issuing country).
        \item $ N $: check digit for the optional data.
        \item $ O $: check digit for the document (overall).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
