# Changelog for darksimplicity theme

This document will state what changes are made to the original theme and some
implications those changes have. Changes will be built incrementally, so let's
say V2 will apply over V1, not necessarily over the original theme.

## Change 1 - 06/10/2017

  * archetypes: default archetypes file is deleted, a custom one willl be used
    in the root of the page.
  * exampleSite: the folder is deleted because it becomes useless.
  * images: the folder it is deleted because it becomes useless.
  * layouts:
    * \_default:
      * list.html: properly indented to enhance readability.
      * single.html: properly indented to enhance readability.
    * partials:
      * disqus.html: deleted. I don't need that kind of functionallity.
      * footer.html: modified so it does not display text. The default footer
        with the copyright thing didn't please me, so for now I wont use one.
      * google_analytics.html: deleted. I don't intend to use google analytics
        anyway.
      * pagination.html: properly indented to enhance readability.
    * rss.xml: deleted. I don't see the point on offering RSS service (for now).
  * postcss: the folder is deleted because it is useless. I don't know why is
    still present in the original repo.
  * public/css: "un-minify", one line for each object to encrease readability.
  * static/css:
  * LICENSE.md: it is modified to an other license.
  * README.md: modified to show the changes.
