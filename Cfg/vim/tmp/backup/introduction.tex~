\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

More smartphones than PCs are sold over the world in a year. With this new
situation wireless communications are one of the biggest concerns.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Networks with infrastructure}}: they need an access
        point (AP). Security is designed for the communication between the
        device and the AP. It is funded on the assumption that the AP is
        trustworthy. Some examples in the domain of cellular networks are:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Global System for Mobile Communication} (GSM): only
                users are authenticated, confidentiality between device and AP,
                very weak protocols.

            \item $ 3^{rd} $ \textit{Generation} (3G): mutual authentication,
                confidentiality between device and AP, non repudiation is not
                implemented.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{\textit{Networks without infrastructure}} (ad-hoc): the
        devices cooperate to build up the network. Efficiency is severely
        restricted, nodes with very different capabilities. Use of distributed
        PKI, it depends on node availability, not compromised even if some
        node is lost/compromised. Route discovery mechanisms are needed.
        Neighbor confidence is built.

    \item \textbf{\textit{Heterogeneous wireless networks}}: mixture between
        networks with and without infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security Objectives}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Security Objectives}

It is freedom from danger, risk, etc.; safety. Realistically, is a relative
quality that expresses a balance or trade off between risks and the measures
taken to minimize them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Confidentiality: avoid unauthorized access. Encryption.

    \item Integrity: avoid unauthorized data modification. Hash.

    \item Availability: ensure access to authorized users. Authentication and
        non-repudiation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Vulnerability}: weakness of an Information System that can harm the 
company or its operations. Vulnerability appearance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item During the life cycle: incorrect security requisites (or incomplete,
        generally during the analysis phase). Poor system design. Undetected
        programming errors due to poor testing.

    \item During operation: system deployment in an environment more hostile
        than expected. Unsecure system configuration. System incorrect
        administration.

    \item During maintenance: not updating security patches. Poor or inadequate
        maintenance. Addition of new functionalities that bring in new
        vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Threat}: potential violation (accidental otherwise) of Information
Security. Any action that can endanger the security objectives.\\

\textbf{Attack}: materialization of a threat by an intelligent agent (purposeful
action). \\

\textbf{Risk}: probability that a threat materializes, exploiting a
vulnerability and causing harm in a process or system. The non existence of
vulnerabilities would make a system resistant to all threats (zero risk).
